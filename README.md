###Frameworks for TreasureBoat

* JavaWebObjects,  JavaEOAccess, JavaEOControl, JavaFoundation, JavaJDBCAdaptor, JavaXML (???)

###Frameworks for TreasureMap 1

* TBWebCore (we have the Name now, after some testing and decisions the empty Framework will be created)  
* TBFoundation (more about that in upcoming Mail, Ken will create an example)  
* TBLibrary (more about that in upcoming Mail, Ken will create an example)  

###To Do - TreasureBoat

* decide on which license to use.
* write a "Contributor's Agreement" and get signed copies before commits occur.
* get WOLips to use the frameworks in $TB_PROJECT/dist instead of the legacy frameworks.
  (For example, this would enable getting rid of the HelloBoatExe script.)
* finish the classes and the resources in the JavaWebObjects framework and then move on to
  the other frameworks.
* would it not be nice to have a smarter way to package auxiliary resources than JavaXML.jar?

###To Do - TreasureMap

* create Sample (working on that Ray & Ken)
* move/create TBLibrary, TBFoundation, TBContentDelivery (working on that Ken)
* think about Licenses like CDL v.3 ??
* create RoadMap MileStone 2
* add WOInjection to TB
* start delegate work
