###To Do - GBU

* write a "Contributor's Agreement" and get signed copies before commits occur.
* get WOLips to use the frameworks in $TB_PROJECT/dist instead of the legacy frameworks.
  (For example, this would enable getting rid of the HelloBoatExe script.)
* finish the classes and the resources in the JavaWebObjects framework and then move on to
  the other frameworks.
* would it not be nice to have a smarter way to package auxiliary resources than JavaXML.jar?
